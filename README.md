ADDRESS BOOK in Java

This is a quick little project done in my Computer Science Fundamentals II class to help get a better grasp of arrays in Java and their applications! This is an address book that allows you to create a contact list to hold either the default amount or as many as you'd like. The address book also allows you to add and remove contacts. Contacts are based on the 'Person' class, holding very basic information about each person you add.
